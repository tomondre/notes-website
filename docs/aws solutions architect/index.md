# AWS Solutions Architect

## S3

### Lifecycle rules

Transition between storage classes

Classes
1. Standard
2. Standard IA
3. Intelligent Tiering
4. One-Zone IA
5. Glacier Instant Retrieval
6. Glacier flexible retrieval
7. Glacier Deep Archive

Moving objects can be automated via Lifecycle Rules.

### Lifecycle Rules
* Transition Actions - COnfigure objects to transition to another storage class
	* Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
	* Move to Glacier for archiving after 6 months
* Expiration actions - configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
	* Access log files can be set to delete after 365 days
	* Delete incomplete multi-part upload
* Rules can be created for certaing prefix
* Rules can be created for certain object tags

### Storage Class Analysis
* Help to decide when to transition objects to the right storage class
* Recommendation for Standard and Standard IA - Does not work for One-Zone IA or Glacier
* Report is updated daily
* 24 to 48 hours to start seeing data analysis
* Good first step to put together lifecycle rules (or improve them)

### Request Pays
* In general, bucket owner pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer, costs associated with their bucket
* With Requester pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost opf the request and the data download from the bucket
* Helpful when you wsan tto share large datasets with other accounts
* The requester must be authenticated - cannot be anonymous

### Event Notifications
* Use case - generate thumbails of images uploaded to S3
* Can create as many s3 events as desired
* S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can take a minute or longer
* Main destinations:
	1.  SNS
	2. SQS
	3. Lambda Functions
	4. Event Bridge - allows to send the events to over 18 aws services as destinations

### Performance
* Baseline - automatically scales to high requests rates, latency 100 - 200 ms
* Applications can achieve at least 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket
* No limit to the number of prefixes in a bucket
* Improve performance
	* Multi-part upload
		* Recommended for files  > 100 MB, must use for files > 5 GB
		* Can help parallelize uploads - speed up transfers
	* Transfer Acceleration
		* Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the s3 bucket in the target region
		* Compatible with multi-part upload
	* Byte-Range Fetches
		* Parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
		* Better resilience in case of failures
		* Can be used to speed up downloads
		* Retrieve only partial data 
	* S3 Select & Glacier Select
		* Retrieve less data using SQL bu performing servicer-side filtering
		* Can filder by rows & columns - simple SQL statements
		* Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side
	* Batch Operations
		* Perform bulk operations on existing S3 objects with a single request, example
			* Modify object metadata & properties
			* Copy objects between s3 bucket
			* Encrypt un-encrypted objects
			* Modify ACLs, tags
			* Restore Objects from S3 Glacier
		* A job consist of a list of objects, teh aciton to perform and optional parameters
		* S3 Batch Operations manages retries, tracks progress, sends completion notifications, generate reports,...
		* S3 Inventory can be used to get object list and use s3


## Databases
* How to choose
	* Question to choose the right database based on architecture
		* Is it read-heavy, write-heavy or balanced workload
		* Throughput needs? Does it need to scale during the day?
		* How much data to store, for how long? Will it grow? Average object size? How accessed?
		* Data durability? Source of truth for the data?
		* Query model? - joins, structured data, semi-structured
		* License costs?
### Types
* RDBMS - RDS, Aurora - great for joins
* NoSQL - DynamoDB, ElsatiCache, Neptune, DocumentDB, Keyspaces - no joins, no SQL
* Object Store - S3 for bigger objects or Glacier for backups

## AWS Security & Encryption
###  Encryption in flight - SSL
* Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
* SSL certificates help with encryption - HTTPS
* Encryption in flight ensures no MITM can happen
### Server-side encryption at rest
* Data is encrypted after being received by the server
* Data is decrypted before being sent
* It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key - usually a data key
* The encryption / decryption key must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it
### Client-side encryption
* Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
* Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
* The server should not be able to decrypt the data
* Could leverage Envelope Encryption

## AWS KMS
* AWS Manages encryption keys for us
* Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
* Easy way to control access to our data
* Able to audit KMS key usage using CloudTrail
* Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services - EBS, S3, RDS, SSM
* Never store secrets in plaintext, especially in the code
	* KM Key Encryoption also available through API calls - SDK, CLI
	* Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment  variables 
* KMS Key Types
	* Symmetric
		* Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
		* AWS Services that are integrated with KMS use symmetric CMKs
		* We never ger access to the KMS Key unencrypted - must call KMS API to use
	* Asymetric
		* Public (Encrypt) and private (Decrypt) pair
		* Used for Encrypt/Decrypt or Sign/Verify operations
		* The public key is downloadable, but we can't access the private key unencrypted
		* User case - encryption outside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API
* Three types
	* AWS Managed Key - free (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)
	* Customer Managed Keys - created in KMS - $1
	* Customer Managed Keys imported - must be 256-bit symmetric key - 1$ / month
* Pay  for API call to KMS - $0.03 / 10000 calls
* Automatic Key rotation
